trial of the right of property under the statute In November 1840 an execution issued from the circuit court of Sumter at the suit of the plaintiff in error requiring the sheriff of that county to make of the goods c of Allen Harrison and others the sum of thirtyseven hundred and seventyseven 80100 dollars besides costs This execution was levied on thirty bales of cotton as the property of Allen Harrison which was claimed and a bond given to try the right An issue was made up to try the question of the liability of the cotton to the plaintiff’s execution and submitted to a jury On the trial a bill of exceptions was sealed at the instance of the plaintiff The plaintiff proved that he recovered his judgment in October 1839 that an execution 741 was issued thereon on the 7th Nov thereafter and that alias and pluries fieri facias’ issued regularly up to the time levy was made that the cotton levied on was growed on the plantation of Harrison and cultivated by the hands in his service It was proved by the claimants by the production of a written contract that Harrison on the twentysecond of May 1840 in consideration that the claimants were involved as indorsers for Burton  Harrison of Sumter county and were then exposed to an execution amounting to upwards of fourteen thousand dollars bargained and sold to the claimants all his growing crop of cotton c consisting of one

existence as to be the subject matter of a sale mortgage or other contract which possess an interest to vest in possession either immediately or at some future time This proposition has frequently

Con 2412 332 Whipple v Foot 2 Johns Rep 422 Stewart v Doughty 9 Johns Rep 112 743 Austin v Sawyer 9 Cow Rep 39 See also Ravesies v Lee  Alston at last term The contract set out in the bill of exceptions we are inclined to think evidences rather a mortgage than an absolute sale It recites that the claimants are involved as indorsers of a mercantile firm of which the defendant was a partner that an execution for upwards of fourteen thousand dollars against their estate is in the sheriff’s hands and that a conveyance is made of the crop of cotton corn and oats which the grantor agrees to give up at any time to the use of the claimants so as to prevent injury to them as indorsers The defendant in execution might at any time have divested the interest which the contract vested in the claimants by discharging their liability as his indorsers or a judgment creditor might have satisfied the lien and', ''), ('unless', 'the crop was gathered have levied on and sold it under a fieri

their engagements as indorsers It is not pretended that their liability has been satisfied and it is admitted that the parties have acted with good faith so that it is a dry question of law whether the right of the plaintiff or the claimants shall prevail Assuming for the present that the execution of the plaintiffs did not operate a lien upon the planted crop previous to the contract of May 1840 we will inquire whether the defendant in execution had such an interest as could be levied on and sold\\r The claimants had previous to the levy of the execution taken possession of the crop prepared the cotton for market and removed it to a warehouse This possession it is insisted was a trespass because it was acquired in the absence of the defendant in execution and without his consent then given Conceding the truth of the facts stated in the bill of exceptions and we think it will not follow that the possession of the claimants is a nullity and that the case must be considered as',

'they took possession of it in the absence of the grantor though without his consent', ''), ('if', 'he subsequently acquiesced in it the inference would be', ''), ('subject to', 'necessary that their acts were approved by him Taking this to be clear 744 law and it will be seen that the defendant in execution at the time of the levy had nothing more than a mere equitable right to redeem the cotton by paying the debts indorsed by the claimants He had no possession coupled with this equity but only a naked equity which it has been held cannot be reached by an ordinary execution Perkins and Elliott v Mayfield 5 Porter’s Rep 182\\r 3 This brings us back to the question whether the execution of the plaintiff was a lien on the growing crop so as to defeat the mortgage to the claimants It has been frequently mooted whether at common law corn c before it is gathered can be seized under a fieri facias Mr Dane in remarking upon this point says “The American editor of Bacon’s Abridgment

the right of property under the statute in november 1840 an execution issued from the circuit court of sumter at the suit of the plaintiff in error requiring the sheriff of that county to make of the goods c of allen harrison and others the sum of thirtyseven hundred and seventyseven 80100 dollars besides costs this execution was levied on thirty bales of cotton as the property of allen harrison which was claimed and a bond given to try the right an issue was made up to try the question of the liability of the cotton to the plaintiff’s execution and submitted to a jury on the trial a bill of exceptions was sealed at the instance of the plaintiff the plaintiff proved that he recovered his judgment in october 1839 that an execution 741 was issued thereon on the 7th nov thereafter and that alias and pluries fieri facias’ issued regularly up to the time levy was made that the cotton levied on was growed on the plantation of harrison and cultivated by the hands in his service it was proved by the claimants by the production of a written contract that harrison on the twentysecond of may 1840 in consideration that the claimants were involved as indorsers for burton  harrison of sumter county and were then exposed to an execution amounting to upwards of fourteen thousand dollars bargained and sold to the claimants all his growing crop of cotton c consisting of one hundred and twenty acres c allen harrison promised and obliged himself to give up his crop to the use of the claimants at any time to save them from suffering as his indorsers if the crop matured and was gathered

interest to vest in possession either immediately or at some future time this proposition has frequently been assumed as unquestionable the point of inquiry generally being whether under a statute of frauds such as the 29 chas 2 it is a mere chattel and transferrable by parol without writing chitty on con 2412 332 whipple v foot 2 johns rep 422 stewart v doughty 9 johns rep 112 743 austin v sawyer 9 cow rep 39 see also ravesies v lee  alston at last term the contract set out in the bill of exceptions we are inclined to think evidences rather a mortgage than an absolute sale it recites that the claimants are involved as indorsers of a mercantile firm of which the defendant was a partner that an execution for upwards of fourteen thousand dollars against their estate is in the sheriff’s hands and that a conveyance is made of the crop of cotton corn and oats which the grantor agrees to give up at any time to the use of the claimants so as to prevent injury to them as indorsers the defendant in execution might at any time have divested the interest which the contract vested in the claimants by discharging their liability as his indorsers or a judgment creditor might have satisfied the lien and when the crop was gathered have levied on and sold it under a fieri facias\\r we will then consider the writing under which the claimants assert a right as a mortgage with a power to take possession any time during the year unless they should be relieved from their engagements as indorsers it is not pretended that their liability has been satisfied and it is admitted that the parties have acted with good faith so that it is a dry question of law whether the right of the plaintiff or the claimants shall prevail assuming for the present that the execution of the plaintiffs did not operate a lien upon the planted crop previous to the contract of may 1840 we will inquire whether the defendant in execution had such an interest as could be levied on and sold\\r the claimants had previous to the levy of the execution taken possession of the crop prepared the cotton for market and removed it to a warehouse this possession it is insisted was a trespass because it was acquired in the absence of the defendant in execution and without his consent then given conceding the truth of the facts stated in the bill of exceptions and we think it will not follow that the possession of the claimants is a nullity and that the case must be considered as if they had never interfered with the crop the contract contains an express undertaking to give up the crop at any time the claimants might require it for their indemnity and if they took possession of it in the absence of the grantor though without his consent if he subsequently acquiesced in it the inference would be if necessary that their acts were approved by him taking this to be clear 744 law and it will be seen that the defendant in execution at the time of the levy had nothing', ''), ('before', 'a mere equitable right to redeem the cotton by paying the debts indorsed by the claimants he had no possession coupled with this equity but only a naked equity which it has been held cannot be reached by an ordinary execution perkins and elliott v mayfield 5 porter’s rep 182\\r 3 this brings us back to the question whether the execution of the plaintiff was a lien on the growing crop so as to defeat the mortgage
